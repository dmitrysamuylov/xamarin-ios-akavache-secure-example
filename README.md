Example of `Xamarin.iOS` and `Akavache.Secure` use

Big thank you to the following sources which helped in putting this together with their content and/or open source software:
- https://github.com/akavache/Akavache
- http://kent-boogaart.com/blog/password-protected-encryption-provider-for-akavache
- https://github.com/andrius-k/AkavacheExplorer.Xamarin
- https://github.com/PureWeen/Akavache.Samples
- https://github.com/akavache/Akavache/issues/190

This was an excerice of trying to get `Akavache.Secure` or `SQLiteEncryptedBlobCache` working to encrypt the local `SQLite` based cache using a custom `EncryptionProvider` implementation.

Here are my stackoverflow posts where I was trying to figure this out and which prompted me to create this sample to test out the process.

Hope this sample helps someone in the future.
